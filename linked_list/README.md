# Linked List In JavaScript

1. Implement two types of a linked list data structure:
  * [ ] with a reference to the tail.
  * [ ] with no reference to the tail.

2. What is the runtime complexity of `add_to_tail`?
  * [ ] with reference to tail?
  * [ ] without a reference to tail?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `remove_head`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `search`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `size`?


## Linked Lists
  * [ ]Should have the methods: `add_to_tail`, `remove_head`, `search`, and `size`.
  * [ ]`add_to_tail` replaces the tail with a new value that is passed in.
  * [ ]`remove_head` removes and returns the head node.
  * [ ] `search` should search through the linked list and return true if a matching value is found.
  * [ ] `size` returns the size of the linked list. 
  * [ ] The `head` property is a reference to the first node and the `tail` property is a reference to the last node. Build your nodes with objects.
